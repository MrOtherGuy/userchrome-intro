# Introduction to Firefox UI styling

This series intends to provide with enough information to get you started on creating your own styles for Firefox. You won't *need* to know all this to use existing styles created by community but you will find that styles tend to get obsolete with updates, or there may be issues that you may not be able to resolve without some deeper knowledge.
